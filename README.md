## Pattern Matching with C#

Pattern matching in C# is a powerful feature that allows developers to write more readable and concise code by checking a value against a pattern. In this session, you will learn how to leverage pattern matching to simplify complex conditional logic and improve code maintainability. We will cover various pattern matching techniques introduced in recent versions of C#, including type patterns, relational patterns, logical patterns, positional patterns, and list patterns. Through practical examples, you will gain a deep understanding of how to use pattern matching effectively in your C# applications. Whether you are new to pattern matching or looking to enhance your existing skills, this session will provide valuable insights and tips for mastering this feature.

## Logs, Metrics, Distributed Tracing, and OpenTelemetry

Grafana? Prometheus? Application Insights? OpenTelemetry? In this session, we will explore how to implement logging, metrics, and distributed tracing in .NET applications for both on-premises and Azure Cloud Services. You will learn how to collect and analyze these data points using tools like Grafana and Prometheus, as well as Azure services such as Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights.
